  Hi there! I'm Hillel (or Hilly) Steinmetz and I'm research assistant with a deep love of learning.
</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm looking for employment. I have plenty of skills that are transferable
  to many roles. I'm pretty good at writing and editing (I especially love turning technical stuff into stories). You can check
  out my articles in the <i>Chicago Maroon</i> <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/contributor/hilly-steinmetz/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  I also have some experience in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. I can work with R, SPSS, Excel,
  and have some basic programming experience. I love a challenge and always welcome opportunities to learning new things.
</p>
  <p>If you'd like, you can check out my resume (Sept 2020) by clicking <a href="/contents/resume-hsteinmetz.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Until recently, I've worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago's
  Department of Psychology where I was involved with project on the psychology of civic virtue,
  the social effects of metaphorical language, and how meaning is conveyed through paralinguistic
  (e.g., pitch) gestures.
</p>
<p>
  My current interests, however, are in social psychology and sociology.
  I'm fascinated by the ways in which the ways individuals understand the world are shaped by their communities and societies.
  I'm particularly interested in how different aspects of our identity inform our political decisions.
