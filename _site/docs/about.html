<p>I’m based in Chicago, but I grew up in snowier Canada. I do feel very strongly connected to Chicago though: my grandparents first met each other in Hyde Park.</p>

<p>I love to read, try to get myself back into shape, and talk about philosophy or religion with friends.</p>

<p>I’ve always been academically-minded, and so I believe that any bio would be incomplete without a brief foray into my academic history.</p>

<p>I started out in college as a religious studies major, but decided to major in linguistics after stumbling into the introductory class
during my first year of college. I was really drawn to the fact that <em>everyone</em> used language, and I thought it was a really great framework for me to come to understand the world.</p>

<p>Later on, I became more interested in using experiments to understand how language worked.
So, until recently, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago’s
Department of Psychology where I was involved with project on the psychology of civic virtue,
the social effects of metaphorical language, and how meaning is conveyed through paralinguistic
(e.g., pitch) gestures.</p>

<p>My current interests have begun to move towards sociology and social psychology.
I’m fascinated by the ways in which the ways individuals understand the world are shaped by their communities and societies.
I’m particularly interested in how different aspects of our identity inform our political decisions.
I can’t wait to see where these new interests take me.</p>
