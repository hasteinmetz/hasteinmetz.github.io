Until recently, I've worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago's
Department of Psychology where I was involved with project on the psychology of civic virtue,
the social effects of metaphorical language, and how meaning is conveyed through paralinguistic
(e.g., pitch) gestures.

My current interests, however, are in social psychology and sociology.
I'm fascinated by the ways in which the ways individuals understand the world are shaped by their communities and societies.
I'm particularly interested in how different aspects of our identity inform our political decisions.
