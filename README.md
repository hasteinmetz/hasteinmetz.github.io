This repository serves as a personal website for Hillel Steinmetz: **[hasteinmetz.github.io](https://hasteinmetz.github.io)**.

Please feel free to make use of the HTML/CSS/Jekyll website template I made (with a huge help from [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)).

If you're a bit confused why you're seeing my face and not something else, this web address was previously used to run an N-Back tasked created by Stephen Van Hedger for a web experiment.
