This repository serves as a personal website for Hillel Steinmetz: **[hasteinmetz.github.io](https://hasteinmetz.github.io)**.

Please feel free to make use of the HTML template I made (with a huge help from W3 Schools).

This web address was previously used to run an N-Back tasked created by Stephen Van Hedger for an experiment based at the University of Chicago.
