    I'm writer and researcher who loves to scour Wikipedia for fun facts. Otherwise, you can find me in the park doing my best to get myself into shape or trying to teach myself to program.
    <br><br>
    I've always been academically-minded, and so I think it makes sense to give a brief overview of my academic history.
    <br><br>
    I decided to major in linguistics after stumbling into the introductory class during my first year of college. I was really drawn to the fact that <i>everyone</i> used language, and I thought it was a really great framework for me to come to learn about diverse ways people on our planet live, behave, and think.
    <br><br>
    I became more interested in using experimental methods to understand how language worked and how language can impact others. So, until August 2020, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Chicago's
    Department of Psychology where I was involved in projects on the psychology of civic virtue,
    the social effects of metaphorical language, and how meaning is conveyed through paralinguistic
    (e.g., pitch) cues.

    Aside from my research interests in language, I love to learn about research on the ways societies and communities can shape the way individuals understand the world.
