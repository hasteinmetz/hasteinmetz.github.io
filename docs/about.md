    I'm writer and researcher who loves to scour Wikipedia for fun facts. Otherwise, you can find me in the park doing my best to get myself into shape or trying to teach myself to program.
    <br><br>
    I really love turning technical, obscure, or enigmatic information into stories that are easy and fun to read.
    I wrote and edited for the <i>Chicago Maroon</i>, my school newspaper, from 2015 to 2017. You can check out my articles in the newspaper
     <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/contributor/hilly-steinmetz/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
    After college, I spent a year doing research in the psychology department.
    Broadly, I wanted to find out how language can impact the way other people think and feel.
    I worked on several studies, including studies on the social effects of metaphorical language,
    the psychology of civic virtue, and the ways meaning is conveyed through paralinguistic cues,
    like pitch and speed.
    <br><br>My research experience gave my a background in data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
    I can work with R, SPSS, Excel. I have programming experience. The introductory computer science courses
    I took used C and Racket, but I can't use them comfortably anymore. I'm probably most proficient in Python.
    <br><br>
    In 2019, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Linguistics.
    I decided to major in linguistics after stumbling into the introductory class and falling in love with the field.
    I was really drawn to the fact that <i>everyone</i> used language. It was the perfect framework for me
    to learn more about diverse ways the people on our planet live, behave, and think.

    Aside from my research interests in language, I love to learn about
    the ways societies and communities shape the way we, as individuals, understand the world.
