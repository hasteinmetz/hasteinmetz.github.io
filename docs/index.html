        Hi there! I'm Hillel Steinmetz (but, I prefer to go by Hilly), and I'm University of Chicago graduate with
        one year of research experience and a deep curiosity about the world.
      </p>
      <p class="main">
        I have a good amount of experience with writing and editing. I especially love creating stories out of technical information.
        I wrote and edited for the <i>Chicago Maroon</i>, my school newspaper, from 2015 to 2017. You can check out my articles in the newspaper
         <a href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/contributor/hilly-steinmetz/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        <br><br>I also have experience with data manipulation, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I can work with R, SPSS, Excel,
        and I have some programming background as well (which came in handy while making this website).
        <br><br>Most importantly, I love to challenge myself, and I'm always welcome opportunities to learning new things.<br><br>
      </p>
