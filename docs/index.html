        Hi there! I'm Hilly, and I'm a technical writer and graduate student at the University of Washington.
        For my current position, I write and edit software documentation. At UW, I'm working towards a masters
        in computational linguistics.

        I made a silly quiz game that you should feel free to play! <a href="/quiz/" target="_blank">Click here</a>
        or the **Language Quiz** button in the navigation bar.
        <br><br>
        The quiz game tests your knowledge of the world's languages. You have to guess
        the country a language is spoken in, what family it belongs to, or identify
        the language from the script it commonly uses.
        <br><br>
        The quiz has data from 655 languages (although 450 of them are pretty obscure).
        The harder the quiz gets, the more points you score. Good luck!
        <br><br>
        You're welcome to look at the
        <a href="https://github.com/hasteinmetz/hasteinmetz.github.io/tree/master/docs/quiz" target="_blank">
          GitHub repository</a> of the quiz (and website).
